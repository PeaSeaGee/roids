## Readable ObjectIDs

[MongoDB](https://mongodb.com) makes extensive use of [ObjectIDs](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/method/ObjectId/), a 12-byte value created from `TIME_32` and some other numbers.
These values are generally rendered as a string of 24 hexadecimal digits.
This project is a JS/HTML translator between this format and other various, hopefully more readable, formats.

This project is probably not meant to be taken seriously.

Serious or not, this project was brought to you by MongoDB Skunkworks, an internal hackathon at MongoDB, Inc. My opinions and errors are my own, however.
